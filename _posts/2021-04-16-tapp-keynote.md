We are glad to announce that [Hazeline Asuncion](https://www.uwb.edu/css/faculty/bios/hasuncion) will be TaPP's keynote speaker. Hazeline Asuncion is an Associate Professor at the University of Washington Bothell.  Her research focuses on traceability of data that may be found in different file types, locations, and owner groups.   In the domain of software engineering, software traceability aids in various development tasks, such as system comprehension, system debugging, and communication between various stakeholders.  In the domain of eScience, tracing how a dataset arrived at its current state, referred to as data provenance, is necessary in assessing a dataset's integrity and in supporting repeatability of analyses or experiments.  She has published over 30 peer-reviewed papers spanning these two topics.  Her work has been funded by the National Science Foundation, including NSF REUs and an NSF Career.  She received her Ph.D., M.S., and B.S., in Information and Computer Science from the University of California, Irvine.
