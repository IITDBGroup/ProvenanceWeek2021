<h3>ProvenanceWeek 2021</h3>
<p>
<b>ProvenanceWeek will take place as a fully virtual event on {{ site.long_dates }}.</b> Following successful previous ProvenanceWeek events, this yearâ€™s installment will again co-locate the IPAW and TaPP workshops as well as host the first Workshop on Provenance and Visualization. IPAW and TaPP build on a successful history of provenance workshops that bring together researchers from a wide range of computer science fields including workflows, semantic web, databases, high performance computing,  distributed systems, operating systems, programming languages, and software engineering, as well as researchers from other fields, such as biology and physics that have urgent provenance needs.
</p>

<p>
  Because of the COVID 19 situation, ProvenanceWeek 2020 was held as a 1-day
virtual event with brief teaser talks. ProvenanceWeek 2021 will bring together
authors of the 2020 papers as well as co-locating the 2021 installment of TaPP
and presentations by IPAW authors for a 2021 submission round.
</p>

<p>
  While also virtual, the 2021 edition we will be a full 4 day event.
</p>

<p>
  Provenance is increasingly important in data science, cloud computing, workflow systems, and many other areas. By providing a record of the data creation process and of dependencies between data, provenance information is essential for tracing errors in transformed data back to erroneous inputs, access control, auditing, repeatability and reproducibility, evaluating data quality, and establishing ownership of data.
