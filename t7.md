## Workshop on Provenance for Transparent Research

The public and the press already expect to assess the trustworthiness of research relevant to pressing social and public health issues in terms of transparency. While reliable provenance is widely recognized as a critical component of research reproducibility in principle, its promise for making research fully transparent---and scientific claims easier to evaluate---has yet to be realized in full. In particular, it is still far from routine for researchers in the natural, social, and data sciences to assess the trustworthiness of reported results using automatically captured provenance information.

This workshop aims to engage Provenance Week attendees in a focused conversation about how methods for automated provenance capture, storage, query, inference, and visualization can make research more transparent and the trustworthiness of results easier to evaluate, both by other researchers and by the public. In brief presentations speakers will propose actionable definitions of terms such as *transparent*, *trustworthy*, and *traceable*; identify needs of particular research communities and other stakeholders; prioritize desiderata for real-world system implementations; and highlight remaining research and engineering challenges. All workshop participants will be invited to comment and contribute their own definitions, priorities, and user requirements in real time via shared documents. The suggestions will be ranked by priority and degree of consensus during a final discussion, and the resulting recommendations and rankings included in a workshop report.

### Seven T-Words: Principles of Transparent Research

A central aim of the workshop is to move beyond the debates around the R-words (*reproducible*, *replicable*, *repeatable*, etc) to focus on the elements of excellent research that the R-words ultimately represent and that automated provenance management can help deliver:

- *Transparent* research processes that facilitate review and assessment
- *True* records of the methods and processes yielding research artifacts
- *Traceable* derivations of individual data product lineages
- *Trials* demonstrated to rigorously enact well-defined study designs
- *Tests* of hypotheses, protocols, and conclusions that are readily reviewed 
- *Timely* application of research outcomes to address pressing problems
- *Trustworthy* publications, results, and recommendations

### Suggested Themes for Presentations
- Significance of research transparency in addressing 21st-century existential threats
- Actionable definitions of *transparency*, *traceability*, and related T-words 
- R-words meet T-words: how reproducibility enables transparency and vice versa
- Transparent research objects: standards and interoperability
- Provenance in support of FATE and FAIR principles
- Needles in a haystack: querying and visualizing lineages of particular research products
- What can I ask? Vocabularies and query languages for delivering traceability
- Attachment issues: associating domain-specific concepts with computational artifacts
- Unsolved problems: opportunities for collaboration and funding
