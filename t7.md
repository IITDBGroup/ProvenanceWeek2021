## Workshop on Provenance for Transparent Research

This workshop aims to engage Provenance Week attendees in a focused conversation about how methods for automated provenance capture, storage, query, inference, and visualization can make research more transparent and the trustworthiness of research results easier to evaluate, both by other researchers and by the public. In brief presentations speakers will propose actionable definitions of terms such as transparent, trustworthy, and traceable; describe the needs of particular research communities and other stakeholders; prioritize desiderata for real-world system implementations; and highlight remaining research and engineering challenges. Workshop participants will comment and contribute their own definitions, priorities, and user requirements in real time via shared documents. The full set of suggestions will be collectively ranked by priority and degree of consensus during a final discussion, and the resulting recommendations and rankings will be included in a workshop report.
