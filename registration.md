**ProvenanceWeek [registration](https://forms.gle/wsBbHkita4uSqDq56) is now open!**

**Participation** in ProvenanceWeek is **free** and includes **all events** --[TaPP]({{ site.baseurl }}/tapp), [IPAW]({{ site.baseurl }}/ipaw), [ProvViz]({{ site.baseurl }}/provviz), and [T7]({{ site.baseurl }}/t7)--but **requires registration**.

However, to cover the publication fees and other costs, **a fixed fee will be charged per IPAW / TaPP / demo / poster paper**. This fee is paid for by one author registering using paid registration.

- $200 per full paper (TaPP / IPAW)
- $50 per poster/demo paper

Please note that if you have more than one paper accepted (including papers of 2020 and 2021), the registration fees add up. For example,    if you have 1 full paper in 2020, two full papers in 2021, and one demo in 2021, we should receive $200 + 2 * $200 + $50 = $650 - it
does not matter which author is paying the fees.

Please proceed to the [Registration Form](https://forms.gle/wsBbHkita4uSqDq56)


**Important notes:**
- **We do not require you to enter a valid phone number and state.** However, **we need your email address** to send you the Zoom link for the event. We would have removed the phone and state questions, but because of limitations of the registration system this was not possible.
- For authors that want to **register for multiple papers**: you have to go through the registration process once per paper. Again, limitations of the registration system prevent us from fixing this.
- For registration reimbursements please list the titles of the papers you have paid for in Section 2 of the [Registration Form](https://forms.gle/wsBbHkita4uSqDq56)
