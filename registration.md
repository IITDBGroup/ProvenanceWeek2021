**ProvenanceWeek registration will open soon!**

ProvenanceWeek registration is **free** for attendees. However, to cover the publication fees and other costs, **a fixed fee will be charged per IPAW / TaPP / demo / poster paper**. This fee is payed for by one author registering using payed registration.

- $200 per full paper (TaPP / IPAW)
- $50 per poster/demo paper

Please note that if you have more than one paper accepted (including papers of 2020 and 2021), the registration fees add up. For example,    if you have 1 full paper in 2020, two full papers in 2021, and one demo in 2021, we should receive $200 + 2 * $200 + $50 = $650 - it
does not matter which author is paying the fees.
