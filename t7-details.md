title: Instructions for T7 Workshop Participants
---

The following are instructions for participants of the *[T7 Workshop on Provenance for Transparent Research]({{ site.baseurl }}/t7)*.

## Please note that this workshop is actually going to be a little different

It is easy to read through a description of yet another call for abstracts and expect an advertised workshop to be like others.  No matter how a workshop is described, we generally assume that, in the end, a workshop will in fact comprise a series of presentations, with time allocated--sometimes--for a few questions between each talk. 

This workshop aims to be different. Here is how:

* **Presentations generally will be brief.**  Presenters will be given five minutes to speak. The experience will be somewhere between a series of lightning talks and a panel discussion. The keynote will be the single exception.

* **Equal time will be allocated to presentations and discussion.** A five-minute discussion will follow each 5 minute presentation. The workshop will conclude with a longer discussion for a final group assessment of the material shared during the workshop.

* **Presenters will explicitly identify their claims.** Speakers are asked to summarize the insights and arguments they share during their presentations.  These summaries will take the form of short assertions that can be assessed by the workshop participants and included in a workshop report with those assessments.

* **Giving a voice to *non-speakers* is the goal of the workshop.**  An online audience response system will enable all workshop participants to react to and provide feedback on the assertions made during the presentations and discussions--even if they never enable their microphones. Feedback will be gathered via polls during and after each presentation.  Identifying oneself with feedback provided this way will be optional.

* **The objective is a *shared* assessment of the topics discussed**. We will collect and include the claims and feedback provided throughout the workshop in a workshop report. Our hope is that the report will help drive future research and development leading to greater transparency in computatationally-enabled research.

* **We are not seeking consensus**. Diverse research communities stand to gain from better approaches to transparency, provenance management, and research quality. We do not expect all of the communities represented at the workshop to have the same needs. Claims that yield bimodal distributions in the levels of agreement are welcomed--and possibly the most useful outcome of this workshop.  We will highlight these divergent viewpoints and priorities in the workshop report.

## Instructions for presenters

* **Organize presentations around your claims**.  Participants *do* want to hear about your latest results. However, they are even more interested in how your results can help them and their research communities. Please use the content that would normally form the core of your presentation as supporting material for the definitions, insights, and arguments you are sharing. 

* **Phrase your insights to invite assessment**.  We want to find out what workshop participants think about the insights you share with them. We will employ simple polling approaches to do this in real time. Please consider how best to phrase your insights so that they can easily be assessed, e.g. on a five-level [Likert-type scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale).

* **Be ready to hear alternative viewpoints**. Our audience response system will enable workshop participant to suggest alternatives to the insights that you share. For example, if a speaker asserts that "*We must ensure that researchers provide complete metadata for all data sets*", an audience member may counter (anonymously) with the claim *"Incomplete metadata is preferable to incorrect metadata"*.  The audience would then assess the value of both claims, possibly after a discussion that considers the assumptions, implications and limitations of each point of view.
